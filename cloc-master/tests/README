To run the tests:
  cd ../Unix
  make test

Unless you see a clear error message, all tests have been executed
successfully.

Tests 21 through 24 in t/01_opts.t exercise cloc's ability to work
with git submodules (specifically, to ignore code in these).  If 
you're working with a git repo clone you will need to clone the
submodule via
  cd ../Unix
  git clone https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc_submodule_test.git
  
If the directory already exists, then update by
  git pull

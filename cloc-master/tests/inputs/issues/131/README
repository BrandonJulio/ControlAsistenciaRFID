This directory contains inputs for tests 21 through 24 in cloc/Unix/t/01_opts.t 
The tests exercise cloc's ability to work with git submodules (specifically, 
to ignore code in these).  If you're working with a git repo clone you will 
need to update the submodule via
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
issued within your cloc working directory to get the tests to pass.

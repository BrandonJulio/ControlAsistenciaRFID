Issue #132 (https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc/issues/132) needs
a non-git controlled subdirectory called 'ignore_git' created 
here.  Copy into this new directory the file hi.py from the 
test inputs directory.

    # if cwd is cloc/tests/inputs/issues/132/ then:
    mkdir ignore_git
    cp ../../hi.py ignore_git/

    # if cwd is cloc/ then:
    mkdir tests/inputs/issues/132/ignore_git
    cp    tests/inputs/hi.py tests/inputs/issues/132/ignore_git/

    # if cwd is cloc/Unix then:
    mkdir ../tests/inputs/issues/132/ignore_git
    cp    ../tests/inputs/hi.py ../tests/inputs/issues/132/ignore_git/

Note:  The actions above are done automatically when running 
'make test' in the cloc/Unix directory.

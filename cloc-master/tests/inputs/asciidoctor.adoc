== NAME

asciidoctor - converts AsciiDoc source files to HTML, DocBook and other formats

== SYNOPSIS

*asciidoctor* [_OPTION_]... _FILE_...

== DESCRIPTION

The asciidoctor(1) command converts the AsciiDoc source file(s) _FILE_ to HTML5, DocBook 5, DocBook 4.5, man(ual) page and other custom output formats.

If _FILE_ is _-_ then the AsciiDoc source is read from standard input.

== OPTIONS
////
=== Security Settings

*-B, --base-dir*=_DIR_::
  Base directory containing the document and resources.
  Defaults to the directory containing the source file, or the working directory if the source is read from a stream.
  When combined with the safe mode setting, can be used to chroot the execution of the program.

*-S, --safe-mode*=_SAFE_MODE_::
  Set safe mode level: _unsafe_, _safe_, _server_ or _secure_.
  Disables potentially dangerous macros in source files, such as `include::[]`.
  If not set, the safe mode level defaults to _unsafe_ when Asciidoctor is invoked using this script.

*--safe*::
  Set safe mode level to _safe_.
  Enables include directives, but prevents access to ancestor paths of source file.
  Provided for compatibility with the asciidoc command.
  If not set, the safe mode level defaults to _unsafe_ when Asciidoctor is invoked using this script.

=== Document Settings
////

*-a, --attribute*=_ATTRIBUTE_::
  Define, override or delete a document attribute.
  Command-line attributes take precedence over attributes defined in the source file unless the value ends with _@_.
+
_ATTRIBUTE_ is normally formatted as a key-value pair, in the form _NAME=VALUE_.
Alternate acceptable forms are _NAME_ (where the _VALUE_ defaults to an empty string), _NAME!_ (unassigns the _NAME_ attribute) and _NAME=VALUE@_ (where _VALUE_ does not override value of _NAME_ attribute if it's already defined in the source document).
Values containing spaces should be enclosed in quotes.
+
This option may be specified more than once.

////
*-b, --backend*=_BACKEND_::
  Backend output file format: _html5_, _docbook5_, _docbook45_ and _manpage_ are supported out of the box.
  You can also use the backend alias names _html_ (aliased to _html5_) or _docbook_ (aliased to _docbook5_).
  Other values can be passed, but if Asciidoctor cannot resolve the backend to a converter, it will fail.
  Defaults to _html5_.
////

*-d, --doctype*=_DOCTYPE_::
  Document type: _article_, _book_, _manpage_ or _inline_.
  Sets the root element when using the _docbook_ backend and the style class on the HTML body element when using the _html_ backend.
  The _book_ document type allows multiple level-0 section titles in a single document.
  The _manpage_ document type enables parsing of metadata necessary to produce a man page.
  The _inline_ document type allows the content of a single paragraph to be formatted and returned without wrapping it in a containing element.
  Defaults to _article_.

=== Rendering Control

*-C, --compact*::
  Compact the output by removing blank lines.
  (No longer in use).
